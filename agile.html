            <p>
                The Agile methodology is a project management approach that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement. Teams follow a cycle of planning, executing, and evaluating.

                   <B>Why choose agile</B><br>
                   Teams choose agile so they can respond to changes in the marketplace or feedback from customers quickly without derailing a year's worth of plans. "Just enough" planning and shipping in small, frequent increments lets your team gather feedback on each change and integrate it into future plans at minimal cost.

            <h1>The six phases of the Agile life cycle</h1>
            <p>
                The Agile software development life cycle is the structured series of stages that a product goes through as it moves from beginning to end. It contains six phases: concept, inception, iteration, release, maintenance, and retirement.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                <a href="agile.html"><img src="C:\Users\Aastha\OneDrive\Desktop\agile\6_phases.png"width="300"height="200"></a>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                1.Concept: First up is the concept phase. Here, a product owner will determine the scope of their project. If there are numerous projects, they will prioritize the most important ones. The product owner will discuss key requirements with a client and prepare documentation to outline them, including what features will be supported and the proposed end results.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                2. Inception: Once the concept is outlined, it is time to build the software development team. A product owner will check their colleagues availability and pick the best people for the project while also providing them with the necessary tools and resources. They can then start the design process.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                3. Iteration: Next up is the iteration phase, also referred to as construction. It tends to be the longest phase as the bulk of the work is carried out here. The developers will work with UX designers to combine all product requirements and customer feedback, turning the design into code. The goal is to build the bare functionality of the product by the end of the first iteration or sprint.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                4. Release: The product is almost ready for release. But first, the quality assurance team needs to perform some tests to ensure the software is fully functional. These Agile team members will test the system to ensure the code is clean â€” if potential bugs or defects are detected, the developers will address them swiftly.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                5. Maintenance: The software will now be fully deployed and made available to customers. This action moves it into the maintenance phase. During this phase, the software development team will provide ongoing support to keep the system running smoothly and resolve any new bugs.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                6. Retirement: There are two reasons why a product will enter the retirement phase: either it is being replaced with new software, or the system itself has become obsolete or incompatible with the organization over time. The software development team will first notify users that the software is being retired.
